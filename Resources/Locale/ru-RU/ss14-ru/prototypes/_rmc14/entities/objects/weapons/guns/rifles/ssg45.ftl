ent-WeaponRifleSSG45 = SSG-45 Assault Rifle
    .desc = Developed by Weston-Yamada as a modern successor to the aging M5 platform, the SpezialSturmGewehr is engineered for precision mid-to-long range combat. Chambered in 7x62mm caseless rounds, it offers superior stopping power and ammunition efficiency compared to the M54C MK2, while maintaining comparable performance in close-quarters engagements. Weston-Yamada’s PMC forces found the UNMC’s M54C increasingly ill-suited to their operational demands, particularly in extended-range missions where precision and firepower were paramount. This dissatisfaction prompted Weston-Yamada’s R&D division to design the SSG, tailoring it to meet the specific needs of their operatives.
